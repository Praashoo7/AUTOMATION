There are Two Different Codes.

First It Removes The Duplicate Files of Given File From Given Path.
Second File is same as the First one But, FILE_PATH and ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME is provided in the Program already and the Script runs Every 20 Seconds To check the Duplications.

Both Programs Remove every Duplication of Given File except the Given File.
