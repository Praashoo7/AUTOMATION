1. In FileDuplication.py, It Removes The Duplicate Files of Given File From Given Path.

2. In FileDuplication1.py, File is same as the First one But, FILE_PATH/FOLDER_NAME and ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME is provided in the Program already and the Script runs Every 20 Seconds To check the Duplications. After removing the Duplications Names of The Duplicate Files are Stord in the log.txt File.
